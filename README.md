how the model penalizes words or phrases based on their frequency of occurrence in the training data.
This option can be useful if you want to control what
how often the model uses certain words or phrases in responses.

temperature - is responsible for the degree of randomness and diversity in responses,
generated by the OpenAI API model.
It affects the "creativity" of the model when generating text.
